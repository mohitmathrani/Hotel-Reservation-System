Description:
This project involves the design and implementation of a robust hotel reservation database to address the challenges posed by the increasing number of cancellations and no-shows in online booking channels. The dataset used for this project comprises approximately 36,000 booking transactions conducted through online channels, containing over 20 columns of relevant information. Key columns include Booking ID, Parking Space Requirement, Booking Status (Cancelled or Not Cancelled), Room Type, Meal Type, and Average Price of Booked Rooms.

Problem Statement:
The prevalence of online hotel reservation channels has led to a shift in customer behavior, resulting in a significant rise in cancellations and no-shows. Guests often exploit the free or low-cost cancellation policies, causing hotels to incur revenue loss and operational challenges. To mitigate these issues, it is essential to develop a solution to address the increasing number of cancellations and no-shows, which adversely affect hotel revenue and operations.

Proposed Solution:
Identify customers who have repeatedly cancelled their reservations (more than 5 times) and take appropriate action to mitigate revenue loss and operational challenges. This may involve blocking the accounts of such customers from the online reservation site to prevent further cancellations.

Technologies Used:

MySQL: Used as the database management system to store and manage hotel reservation data.
Python: Utilized MySQL Connector in Python to interact with the MySQL database and execute queries to manipulate and analyze data.
